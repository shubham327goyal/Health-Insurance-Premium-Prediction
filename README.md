## Introduction
Medical expense coverage is one of the benefits of health insurance. By paying a specific premium, a person who has purchased a health insurance policy receives health insurance coverage. The cost of health insurance is influenced by numerous variables.

## Health Insurance Premium Prediction
The cost of a health insurance policy's premium varies from person to person since a variety of factors play a role in this decision. Taking age as an example, a young individual has far lower risk of developing serious health issues than an older person. As a result, treating an elderly patient will cost more than treating a young patient. Because of this, an older individual must pay a higher premium than a young person.

Just like age, many other factors affect the premium for a health insurance policy.

The dataset that I am using for the task of health insurance premium prediction is collected from Kaggle. It contains data about:

- the age of the person
- gender of the person
- Body Mass Index of the person
- how many children the person is having
- whether the person smokes or not
- the region where the person lives
and 
- the expenses of the insurance premium
